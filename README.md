# Create a Database Using NoSQL (MongoDB)

## NoSQL Database (MongoDB)
1. Choose MongoDB as the NoSQL database.
2. Create a database and collections based on Alusive Africa grant application dataset.
3. Design the schema and collections structure.

# SQL Database

## Choose a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
1. Select an RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
2. Create a schema with at least two tables based on a water quality dataset.

### Structure:
- **Design the Schema:**
  - Plan and create the database schema.
  - Define tables, columns, and relationships.
  
- **Define Primary and Foreign Keys:**
  - Ensure each table has a primary key.
  - Establish foreign key relationships between tables where necessary.

# Create API Endpoints for CRUD Operations

## Technology Stack
1. Choose a framework for creating the API (e.g., Node.js with Express, Flask, Django, Fast).

## Endpoints
1. **Create (POST)**
   - Endpoint to create new entries in the database.
   
2. **Read (GET)**
   - Endpoint to fetch existing data from the database.
   
3. **Update (PUT)**
   - Endpoint to update existing entries in the database.
   
4. **Delete (DELETE)**
   - Endpoint to delete entries from the database.

# Create a Script to Fetch Data for Prediction

## Fetch Data of the Latest Entry
1. Write a script to fetch the latest data entry from the API.

## Prepare Data for Prediction
1. Load the model created in the "Intro to Machine Learning" course.
2. Prepare the input data and use the model to make predictions.
